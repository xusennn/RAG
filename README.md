Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Tourism Recommendation

This project is a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides travel-related answers based on user questions. It uses both ChromaDB and FAISS as interchangeable vector database backends and supports semantic search with large pre-trained embedding models.

Note: The sample tourism dataset (tourism_data_1000.json) was generated using GPT for testing purposes only. It is not based on authoritative or verified sources and should not be considered accurate or complete.

Edit main.py to toggle backend:

use_faiss = True  # or False

！！！This project is for educational and demonstrational purposes only！！！
